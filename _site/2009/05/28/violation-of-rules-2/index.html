	<div class="post-content"><div>Hope you are all aware of the rules to be followed in train. Right from booking tickets to travel without disturbing the public,common people follow the rules properly. It is the politicians and other big-shots who violate the rules.</div><div>Before a couple of months, me and my friend were traveling by train. Its a 12 hr journey. A full night travel actually. We witnessed 6 people drinking liquor. They were sitting next to us(Separated by a partition). We dint notice that they were drinking. We thought they are having non-veg. After sometime, we noticed that they were drinking. We dint know how to react. The TTR came to us. He asked me "What are you doing?". As I was nervous, I said "Just sitting idle". He smiled and asked "College?". I said "Yes".Then he said "These people are of high political influence and I cant prevent them from drinking. If you want, I will make arrangement for change of berth".I said "We need another berth.Pls do make arrangements for it". He got berths for us in another compartment and we left there.</div><div>And yesterday, I came across another few people who were consuming liquor in train,in front of the TTR.</div><div>Rules must be unbiased. These political heads make our society unruly and blame the public!</div><div>It makes train journey uncomfortable. Lack of safety.Â </div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
