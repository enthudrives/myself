	<div class="post-content"><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/archu1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:0 none;" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/archu1.jpg?w=110" alt="" width="110" height="133" border="0" /></a>
It happened an year ago. I said *Sayounara* to my car and came home from school with my best buddy,Archana in her black scooty pep+. I am a rash rider.
<a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/images1.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="border:0 none;" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/images1.jpg?w=78" alt="" width="78" height="105" border="0" /></a>It wasnt raining when we left the school. But within a minute, it started raining heavily. We dint want to wait. We wanted to have some fun. I was riding the vehicle at 40 kmph on the National Highways on that day. As usual, Archu was slapping me and screaming "Suganthi... Go slow!!". I dint give a damn to it. Actually,Archu was too happy with the ride. But she was a little scared. We happened to see one of our schoolmates in front of his house. We howled and shouted "BYE" to him. We were singing songs on the road. We reached home entirely drenched in rain. My mom was shocked on seeing us. She was wondering for a moment,thinking who these people are. Our white uniform was entirely spoilt! It became brown in color.
<div>This incident is the most unforgettable incident ever. Till today, whenever it rains, me and Archu think about tat awesome day. I just miss that day. Love you Archu. :)</div>
