		<div class="post-content"><div><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SulYEbYAceI/AAAAAAAAAdk/21V7gzdnfBA/s1600/hands.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SulYEbYAceI/AAAAAAAAAdk/21V7gzdnfBA/s320/hands.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div>Caste system prevails in India from time immemorial. Even when most of the people are civilized, they still have the caste feeling. Everyone is just ready to say "All are equals". But what is the big deal in practicing it in real life? On the basis of job and the position they held in the society, people divided themselves into castes. But it is nt still the same! <br /><div><br /><div>Wedding could be a good example. When a gal is in love with a guy, the parents ask "Which caste does he belong to?" instead of asking "Is he good or bad? Working or not?". And if they both are not of the same caste, the parents will be ready to marry their daughter to some dumb guy of their caste,without bothering about whether they will like each other or not!</div><div><br /><div>Communal reservation is another crap! Educational system which has to eradicate caste feeling, has communal reservation! Why is that an FC candidate with 100% marks and SC candidate with 70% marks considered equal? Is there no SC candidate who scored 100%?  Then why should there be such a foolish discrimination in the name of reservation? Why no one is able to bring a change in this?  Political leaders! OMG! They are really brilliant! They make fools out of us. In the "equality", they increase this discrimination day by day.<br /><div>People must think about it. When we are ready to change our style of living, why should this caste system still survive in the society?This has to change.</div></div></div></div>

		<div class="post-content"><p>SSN EDC organized a 3-day 50 rupee activity in our campus.</p>  <p> *3 to 4 per team</p>  <p>*Each team will be given with 50 bucks</p>  <p>*The activity is to multiply this 50 bucks in 3 days</p>  <p>Enlightened Minds is a team constituted by Sindhu,Preethi,Niveditha and Myself. </p>  <p>We mailed our ideas to the activity coordinators. Our idea was accepted and we were qualified for the activity. It was conducted from 16.09.2k9 to 18.09.2k9. </p>  <p>Here is what we did:</p>  <p>All four of us worked towards creating articles for our magazine “Zeitgeist”. The soft copy was ready by 10 pm. Sindhu took printouts in her house. Around 30 copies. Hats off Sindhu, for working till 12 am. :-) </p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SrTv1zFnbWI/AAAAAAAAAcM/WjKctj3Felc/s1600-h/DSC00821%5B2%5D.jpg"><img title="DSC00821" height="184" alt="DSC00821" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SrTv2yDlhDI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/sMNYl1-hDnY/DSC00821_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Day 1:</u></strong></p>  <p> After all formalities were over, we started our business by 9 am. Our magazine consists of 16 pages(including the cover page). We sold it for 7 bucks. We sold the 1st copy to my class in-charge Mr.Sujaudeen. We sold the magazines to almost all staff. Our staff were very pleased to know that we came up with an innovative idea. With the profit we earned by selling those 30 copies, we made 100 copies in our college stores. We sold those 100 copies also by 3 pm. By the end of day 1, we had 831 bucks in hand :D</p>  <p><strong><u>Day 2:</u></strong></p>  <p>We sold bracelets, mobile tags and thumb rings. The credits again go to Sindhu. She is the one who got these goods. Her brother got these stuff in bulk. We invested a part of the amount we made on day 1. By the end of day 2, we had 1700 bucks with us(including what we made on day 1).</p>  <p><strong><u>Day 3:</u></strong></p>  <p>We sold the left out accessories and made 240 bucks. The sales closed by 1 pm.</p>  <p> Our 3 days of life as business women was a good experience. Am also an entrepreneur now :D</p>  <p>Thanks to SSN EDC :) </p>

<div>When I was in school, I never dreamt of getting into any college like CEG or IIT or NIT like others do. I couldnt dream of medial college as I was in Math-Comp Sci group. I just wanted to get into any good institution in Chennai. I wanted to study in Chennai because my close cousins are in Chennai and I wanted to hang out with them. Also I wanted to enjoy Life. I was a kinda studious in my 11th and 12th. Did my final exams well. I came to know about SSN from my friend's Dad. He mentioned SSN in the list of good colleges. I dint know even the expansion of SSN then. Finally, my results were out. My cut off was lesser than what I expected(194.5 on 200). My friend's dad(who said about SSN) called me and asked which college I would join. I said "We will try for SSN through Management". He asked "Is it possible to get into SSN with this cut-off?"</div>
<div>I enquired many people immediately. Only after that I came to know that <strong>Money or Recommendation can do nothing in SSN</strong>. This impressed me so much. My craze to get into SSN increased. I always like doing things which people think impossible. Only after that, I came to know everything about SSN. SSN gives a long rope to its students. Mobiles are allowed. No dress code. Girls can speak with guys. Wow. Heaven. Then I visited the site www.ssn.edu.in. The infrastructure impressed me even more. With a great desire to get CSE in SSN,I filled the application form for management quota. I was called for the interview.</div>
<div>I went to the college for the first time on June 17th. Cool. Such a great college with cool lawns, well designed buildings. Many students attended the interview with me. I got 79% in the aptitude test conducted there. Most of the people with 195+ cut off, who were called on 16th scored an average of 40-50. This increased my hope to get into SSN. Then the interview. My interviewers were Dr. Srinivasan and Dr. Radha. Dr. Srinivasan is a witty person. I was nervous about the interview because i know very well that I am too bad at GK. Looking into my application, Dr.Srinivasan asked "Oh you are from tirunelveli? What is Tirunelveli famous for?". I answered with a smile "Halwa". He was asking about halwa during the entire session. And said "Your interview is over!". Thank God this was just to test my fluency! I came off.</div>
<div>After few days, the result of this selection process was announced. I got into IT(which was my 2nd option) and was in waiting list for CSE. I decided to join IT expecting a course change. College reopened. I joined the college as an IT student. After a month, I got transfered to CSE. I was the last student to undergo this course change. This is what my fate is like. I have never got anything as soon as I wish. But I will get it on the day when I myself lose hope of getting it.</div>
<div>Finally, I got into my dream course in my dream college. I am a proud SSNite now. :)</div>

They generate your output.  Wolfram alpha is a search engine where you get answers for your questions.  It is very often referred to as "computational knowledge engine."  Fpr eg, I entered the question "How old are you?". It returned its age since it was launched. This search engine is in its developed stage. So you cannot expect answers for all your questions. As of now, you can know about any particular date,town,stocks,mathematical formulae,calculations. The search engine was launched before a month. Let us wait for it to get developed. :)</span>

I can give you the direct link to download.Here we go<div> http://www.gianniamato.it/grc/GRC.zip</div><div>All you have to do is hust unzip it. Run the file GRC.exe</div><div>Trust me. Its not virus!!</div><div>Now, you will be able to see this window.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><br /></div><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SkC822E9AUI/AAAAAAAAAUI/I9i4n-qPgNQ/s320/grc.JPG" border="0" alt="" /><div>Sign in here with your gmail id and password. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once you are logged in with GRC, it checks your inbox every 60 seconds for new command mails. </div><div><br /></div><div>For example, I wanna open my system's calculator.

I use to celebrate it in a grand fashion. Every year, I go to my school in non-uniform(new dress), distribute sweets to friends and staffs etc. This year, june14th 2009, happened to be a sunday. My second semester examz were going on. I had math exam on 15th. So everyone were serious with their math preparations. I knew that this b'day is gonna be the worst. But my friends at hostel arranged for a chocolate cake. Cut it at 12 am. We settled bak to work within half and hr. Almost all my close friends called me by 12 and greeted me. All my celebs came to an end by around 12.30. Mom and Dad called sharp at 7.59 am, coz i was born at 8 am it seems.</p>

<div>My school friends called me and talked to me about the fun-filled b'day I had last yr. It was the best day I had with them. A cool get together, treat in a big hotel etc. This took me to the past. I became dull and my entire day was gloomy.</div>
<div>I wouldnt have felt desparate if it wasnt during exams. I couldnt spend time to relax or to meditate. I received a courier from my best buddies at school(Malini,Sharmili n Archana). They had sent me a big ceramic doll(a gal shaped doll). As it was sent via courier, it broke into pieces. This too added to my melancholy.</div>
<div>Somehow I am 18. As Malini had mentioned I am votteri nari now. Coz i can vote :P</div>
<div>Keep smiling.. :)</div>

		<div class="post-content"><div>Hope you are all aware of the rules to be followed in train. Right from booking tickets to travel without disturbing the public,common people follow the rules properly. It is the politicians and other big-shots who violate the rules.</div><div>Before a couple of months, me and my friend were traveling by train. Its a 12 hr journey. A full night travel actually. We witnessed 6 people drinking liquor. They were sitting next to us(Separated by a partition). We dint notice that they were drinking. We thought they are having non-veg. After sometime, we noticed that they were drinking. We dint know how to react. The TTR came to us. He asked me "What are you doing?". As I was nervous, I said "Just sitting idle". He smiled and asked "College?". I said "Yes".Then he said "These people are of high political influence and I cant prevent them from drinking. If you want, I will make arrangement for change of berth".I said "We need another berth.Pls do make arrangements for it". He got berths for us in another compartment and we left there.</div><div>And yesterday, I came across another few people who were consuming liquor in train,in front of the TTR.</div><div>Rules must be unbiased. These political heads make our society unruly and blame the public!</div><div>It makes train journey uncomfortable. Lack of safety. </div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>

It happened an year ago. I said *Sayounara* to my car and came home from school with my best buddy,Archana in her black scooty pep+. I am a rash rider.
<a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/images1.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="border:0 none;" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/images1.jpg?w=78" alt="" width="78" height="105" border="0" /></a>It wasnt raining when we left the school. But within a minute, it started raining heavily. We dint want to wait. We wanted to have some fun. I was riding the vehicle at 40 kmph on the National Highways on that day. As usual, Archu was slapping me and screaming "Suganthi... Go slow!!". I dint give a damn to it. Actually,Archu was too happy with the ride. But she was a little scared. We happened to see one of our schoolmates in front of his house. We howled and shouted "BYE" to him. We were singing songs on the road. We reached home entirely drenched in rain. My mom was shocked on seeing us. She was wondering for a moment,thinking who these people are. Our white uniform was entirely spoilt! It became brown in color.
<div>This incident is the most unforgettable incident ever. Till today, whenever it rains, me and Archu think about tat awesome day. I just miss that day. Love you Archu. :)</div>
