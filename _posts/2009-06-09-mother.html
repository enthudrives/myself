A person who thinks of you all the time despite her worries. A person who has a big bag of dreams for you. A person who wants you to be the best of everything. A person who corrects your mistakes. A person who wants to see you happy ever and ever. Yea she is your mom.</div><div>She could understand your feelings from your tiny activities. She can understand your gestures. She slaps you when you go wrong; but she feels sorry for her slapping you and your going wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>I came entirely drenched in rain.</div><div>Brother asked Where did you go?</div><div>Sister said You are jobless</div><div>Relatives asked R u crazy</div><div>Dad asked Why the hell did you go in rain?</div><div>Mom came with a towel and said "Stupid Rain!" with a gentle smile.</div><div><br /></div><div>That is Mom.</div><div>She fights against the whole world for your happiness.</div><div><br /></div><div>She is more than a friend. She gives you money when you want to party with your friends. But have you taken your mom out anyday? She helps you in being happy. But why dont you think that she deserves double that you give to your other friends?</div><div><br /></div><div>Mom will not expect all these from you. But She will be happy if you do it. Try to understand your Mom. She says everything for you only. Don't ever hurt your Mom physically or mentally. Your mom wont curse you. But even the small insects which sees a drop of tear from your mom's eyes will curse you..</div>
