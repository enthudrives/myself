			<h1><a href="/2012/03/08/tag-athon">Tag-athon</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">I was asked to join this "TAG-athon" by <a href="http://preethi-baskar.blogspot.in/">Preethi</a>.

Here goes the set of rules to be copy pasted...
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;"><strong>Rule#1: Put the rules on your blog.</strong>
<strong> Rule#2: Every person tagged should tell 11 things about themselves,Answer the questions asked by the one that tagged you and Tag few other people and ask them few different questions.</strong>
<strong> Rule#3:Let the people whom you tagged know you've done so.</strong>
<strong> Rule#4: Don't tag anyone who's been tagged before.</strong>
<strong> Rule#5: Really do tag 11 others, don't go all ''if you want to take this tag''.</strong></p>
11 things about me..
1) Being a gemini, I cant be just the same to everyone around me. Who I'm depends on who you are.
2)  Most ppl call me a perfectionist. Yea. I am one.
3) I believe in my intuitions. My intuitions work most of the time.
4) I am an independent person. I hate taking "NO" for an answer. So, I dont ask help from anyone if I doubt that the answer may be no.
5) I dont beleive in love at first sight. Love can only happen after knowing each other..their likes and dislikes.
6) I dont blindly believe whatever I hear. I listen to both sides of a story before making conclusions.
7) I love eating. But a little conscious about the number of calories it adds to me :P
8) I love hanging out with friends..visiting new places..doing adventurous stuff.
9) Yes I am a chatterbox. But theres a lot of unspoken words deep down in my heart..
10) I dont regret for anything. "All for the best". I learn from my mistakes.
11) I'm a dreamy person. A lot of random thoughts keep running in my mind almost always.

Hfff! It was so hard for me to blabber 11 things about me. Now, its time to answer Preethi's questions.

1. Your views on God , spirituality , ghosts and athma .
I believe in the uniqueness of God. I am spiritual but not religious. I pray to God whenever I feel like.. I like visiting hindu temples for the architecture and Churches for silence.
I believe in the immortality of souls(athma). They are everywhere. But we cannot feel them because of their low energy level.

2. What makes your life meaningful?
Trying to keep my friends and family happy makes my life meaningful.

3. The best ways to tackle anger and detest.
I dont talk when I'm angry. Because, anger makes you do stupid things which you don't mean to do.
If I hate someone, I ignore whatever they say :P

4. How do you visualize yourself in another 10years.
After 10 years.. I visualize myself as a woman with happy family and successful career.

5. What remains as your far-fetched dream till date?
To take a day off from my routine and stay cool with no responsibilities, no tension.. Havent had any such day so far. :(

6. Something that makes you proud or stays as your identity.
My high energy level.. :D

7. How do you connect with me?
Both of us do not run away from responsibilities. Whatever crazy plan(bunking classes, movies) I make, I know that you will be in for it :P
Now, its my turn to ask few questions:

1) Do you like visiting new/strange places?

2) If given a chance to relive some phase of your life, what would you choose?

3) Whats the best thing that has happened to you so far?

4) Name one person who made a strong impact in your life

5) What are your passions?

6) If given a week off, Where would you go, What would you do?

7) Have you ever felt like you are way too different from the people around you?

Tagging few of my friends now..

			<h1><a href="/2012/02/15/every-cloud-has-a-silver-lining">Every cloud has a silver lining</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">On a pleasant evening, I met Aakriti sitting alone under a tree and enjoying the beauty of Sunset. I sat next to her and started cracking lame jokes. Her reactions were so unusual and it forced me to ask her "Are you alright?". She stared at me for a second and asked me if I had loved someone. Before I could reply, a teardrop rolled down her eyes. Her boyfriend broke up with her before a few days.

She said that she couldnt sleep all night and was not able to eat anything. I patiently listened to her break-up story and asked her "What does your heart want from that guy, now? Do you want him to come back or move on?". She wants to move on. She wants to forget everything and make a new start. Then I asked "What prevents you from doing that right now?". She said "Isnt it too early to move on?".
<a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/alright-break-up-girl-gone-life-favim-com-247291.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-333" title="Wear a mask and go on" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/alright-break-up-girl-gone-life-favim-com-247291.jpg?w=300" alt="It is all about how you take it" width="300" height="199" /></a>
Aakriti is not the only soup girl around. Almost everyone would have gone through this emotional trauma. Here is a short message for all Aakriti's reading my post.
You gotta move on someday. Why is it not TODAY?? Why do you wanna postpone it? Yes. Only Time can heal the pain. But ignore the pain and be happy with what you have around you. Its human nature to fret over something thats not ours. But it is all ILLUSION! The past takes control of your mind and makes you believe that you cant get over it! Your dumb mind blindly believes that its your mourning period and makes you go crazy.

Take full control over your mind. Get involved in stuff and keep yourself occupied. Playing your favourite sport helps. Live like there is no tomorrow. Create beautiful memories before its too late. History is not gonna reward you for being heartbroken. Stand up and face the world. An emotional breakdown should only strengthen you.

Dear Aakriti, One last note. God has better plans for you. You dont know what hes upto. He has his own reasons for breaking up with you. All for the best. Keep smiling :)

			<h1><a href="/2012/02/03/thoughtworks">This is how I got hired at ThoughtWorks</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">I recently attended the thoughtworks recruitment process. I would like to share my experience about the same.
The process had 6 rounds.
<strong> 1. Logic Test</strong>
<strong> 2. Predicting output (20 mins)</strong>
You will be given with 4 not-too-complex programs which involves pointers, left shift, right shift operators. You need to predict their outputs.
<strong>3. Code pairing(75 mins)</strong>
You will be given with a simple scenario and asked to code for the same. You can use C or C++ or Java. Make your code more object oriented and modular. If you use C, concentrate on modularity. Once you get the expected output, one ThoughtWorks employee will evaluate your code. He will check with the test cases. Then, he will want you to do some modifications in your code. He might ask you to extend your code  or modify some functionality of your code.
<strong> 4. Tech Interviews 1 &amp; 2</strong>
To ace the interviews, you need to be strong in the basics OOP, DS, DBMS. "Strong" doesnt mean knowing all definitions. You will be given with some scenario and asked to write db tables and classes for the same. Or you may be given a scenario and asked what data structure can be applied for it. Theres no correct solution for most of the questions they ask in the interview. They just want to look at your thought process. So, dont give up. Keep thinking and most importantly, speak out what you think. Who knows..your answer may be right. Be honest. If you dont know something, admit it.

If you are not sure of anything, dont mention about it in your resume. Believe me. If you mention even a single word about something that you are not confident about, you are digging yourself a big grave.
<strong> 6. Leadership round</strong>
This is just a HR round. They ask few behavioural questions to know about your non-technical self.
After this, the recruiting team head will get back to you with the result. Hurrah! I'm a ThoughtWorker now.

Don't worry if you don't make it this time. You can try again after three months. Good Luck! :)

Jungle book, Adventure Island, Lion king, Car racing, bike racing,contra are a few more games that linger in my mind always.<br />I clearly remember all these games, even their background music. I remember the days when I was so addicted to these games that I wouldnt even sleep dreaming about how to cross levels.<br />The PC version of those games are available. But they can never match the pleasure obtained from playing with video games.. Those joysticks, cassettes can never be replaced. Play station, Kinetic games will always bow to video games.<br /><br />I came across this site recently. I found all my childhood heroes here.

		<div class="post-content"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><br />In my place, Diwali is more like a festival of sound, than festival of lights. We burst hell lot of crackers every year. I learnt to burst crackers when I was 6 years old. Started off with Bijili vedi. Later improved to Laxmi vedi, atom bomb etc in the following years.<br />Every Diwali has left behind some crazy memories. Let me share one of them here. <br /><br />When I was 10, I was bursting some laxmi crackers in the morning. My parents were away and friends too left. One cracker didnot burst. I waited for a while and went near it. No smoke from it. So, I thought that the cracker is a dummy piece and took it in my hand. The thread(thiri) had gone in. I poked the thread hole with a stick and it suddenly burst in my hands. Only after that I noticed that the stick in my hand was a lit bathi(incense stick). Smoke came out from my mouth and ears(Just like <b>Vadivelu</b> in movies) :P <br />Thank God, no one saw me at that moment. I continued bursting crackers like nothing happened. Later my mom found the wound in my hand and the real diwali started for me :P<br /><br />Chinna vayasulayae terror la!! :D<br /><br />Happy and Safe Diwali everyone :) </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>

			<h1><a href="/2011/02/19/three-days-on-the-rails">Three days on the Rails</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">Before 2 yrs, I came to know about Ruby on Rails(RoR) from the internet. I tried learning it. But failed. May be I was very lazy. Recently,I attended a 3 day workshop on Ruby on Rails in my college which helped me to kickstart my RoR learning.
Like I expected, the resource persons were comfy with installing RoR on Windows. They got the exe files in CD. People were running around to get it in their pendrives and installed it on their windows machines. I was sitting in the last bench, installing and learning stuff on my own. Why run for setup files when “yum” or “apt-get” makes things easier for you!! I encountered almost all kinds of errors that could occur on a fedora machine during RoR installation. That is the best part of the workshop. Surfing around lot of forums, I came to know that I am not the only person who suffers from such errors. Errors that occured on my system are quite common among linux RoR-ers. But most of the solutions were available for Ubuntu users. Are there less number of Fedora RoR-ers? I dont know!!
I dedicate this post to all newbies struggling with RoR installation on Fedora ;)

<strong>To install:</strong>
<blockquote>#yum install ruby sqlite rubygems rubygem-sqlite3-ruby
#gem install rails rake</blockquote>
To see the list of gems installed type,
<blockquote>#gem list</blockquote>
Now everything is set and ready to roar.

To test the installation, let us create an application.
<blockquote>$ rails new sample
$ cd sample
$ rails server</blockquote>
This will get your server running.
If you see something like,

=&gt; Booting WEBrick

=&gt; Rails 3.0.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000

=&gt; Call with -d to detach

=&gt; Ctrl-C to shutdown server

it is a sign of proper installation. :)

First, learn the basic syntax of ruby language. There are a plenty of tutorials available on the internet.

Then learn how to create the Model, View and Controller for your application.

I used the following tutorials to get started with RoR:
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart
http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_expressions.html
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

Installation seems to be quite simple, right? Let me post the list of bugs I encountered in this process.
<blockquote>#gem install rails
1 gem installed
Installing ri documentation for rails-3.0.0...
File not found: lib
Installing rdoc documentation for rails-3.0.0...
File not found: lib
Install rdoc and ri before installing rails

#gem install rdoc ri rails</blockquote>
It will work fine.
<blockquote>#gem install sqlite3
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
/usr/bin/ruby extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... no
sqlite3.h is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal'
or 'yum install sqlite3-devel' and check your shared library search path
(the location where your sqlite3 shared library is located).
*** extconf.rb failed *** ....</blockquote>
I think sqlite3 gem is not available for fedora. sqlite3-ruby is a similar gem. So, let us install it.
<blockquote>#gem install sqlite3-ruby
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing sqlite3:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
/usr/bin/ruby extconf.rb
checking for sqlite3.h... no
sqlite3.h is missing. Try 'port install sqlite3 +universal'
or 'yum install sqlite3-devel' and check your shared library search path
(the location where your sqlite3 shared library is located).
*** extconf.rb failed *** ....</blockquote>
Oh no! sqlite3-ruby should be installed using yum. (Chill. Just wanted you to know the problems involved ;))
<blockquote>#yum install rubygem-sqlite3-ruby</blockquote>
This will work perfectly fine. This happens during the installation of most of the gems.
If  “<em>gem install some_gem</em>”  throws a similar error as mentioned above, install it using “<em>yum install rubygem-some_gem</em>” .

<strong>The major cause of any problem arising due to sqlite3 is its improper installation</strong>. It is NOT SAFE to move on with incomplete sqlite3 installation. You will face lot of complicated problems in the later stage.

Now, create your application.
<blockquote>rails new sample
cd sample
rails server</blockquote>
You will get the error
“Could not find sqlite3-1.3.3 in any of the sources”
Because, you have the gem sqlite3-ruby. Not sqlite3. So you should map between these two gems. This can be done using the Gemfile. (sample/Gemfile)

I have shown only the necessary lines of the Gemfile.
<blockquote>gem 'sqlite3'

#..
#..
# gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require =&gt; 'sqlite3'</blockquote>
Uncomment the line “gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require =&gt; 'sqlite3'” and comment the line “gem 'sqlite3'”
Now your Gemfile looks like
<blockquote>#gem 'sqlite3'

#..
#..
gem 'sqlite3-ruby', :require =&gt; 'sqlite3'</blockquote>
Thats it. Now run your server. Don't forget to edit the Gemfile of every new project you create.
<blockquote>$rails server
=&gt; Booting WEBrick

=&gt; Rails 3.0.4 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000

=&gt; Call with -d to detach

=&gt; Ctrl-C to shutdown server</blockquote>
Installation Success :)
