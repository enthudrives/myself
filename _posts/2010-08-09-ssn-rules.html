When I joined college(in 2008), I remember my seniors telling me,
<blockquote>1.No rules in SSN

2. Rule number 1 must be strictly followed!</blockquote>
This was true till the end of my second year. Now strong rules have been imposed! :(

We should get leave letter from parents/warden if we bunk a lab session! Things are not always explainable. If the 3 hrs of lab is not worth attending, it is nothing wrong in bunking it and doing something constructive. We are not kiddos. We know what is right!

We are not supposed to enter hostel before 3.30 pm(except for lunch). If we are ill, we need to get permission from the class incharge before entering the hostel. Isnt it sickening?? A person who is not feeling well should roam about in college, find the staff and get leave letter signed and go to hostel??

Only three outings per month.. This sounds better than the other two rules. But it is not so! :(

What is the necessity of these rules? Every student knows his own responsiblities. They know what is good for themselves. If someone bunks, he obviously knows the consequences. Why did these new rules come into play all of a sudden? Wasnt SSN good without these rules?

I am still happy for the freedom we have in terms of mobile and dress code.
