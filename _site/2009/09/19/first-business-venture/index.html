	<div class="post-content"><p>SSN EDC organized a 3-day 50 rupee activity in our campus.</p>  <p> *3 to 4 per team</p>  <p>*Each team will be given with 50 bucks</p>  <p>*The activity is to multiply this 50 bucks in 3 days</p>  <p>Enlightened Minds is a team constituted by Sindhu,Preethi,Niveditha and Myself. </p>  <p>We mailed our ideas to the activity coordinators. Our idea was accepted and we were qualified for the activity. It was conducted from 16.09.2k9 to 18.09.2k9. </p>  <p>Here is what we did:</p>  <p>All four of us worked towards creating articles for our magazine “Zeitgeist”. The soft copy was ready by 10 pm. Sindhu took printouts in her house. Around 30 copies. Hats off Sindhu, for working till 12 am. :-) </p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SrTv1zFnbWI/AAAAAAAAAcM/WjKctj3Felc/s1600-h/DSC00821%5B2%5D.jpg"><img title="DSC00821" height="184" alt="DSC00821" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SrTv2yDlhDI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/sMNYl1-hDnY/DSC00821_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a></p>  <p><strong><u>Day 1:</u></strong></p>  <p> After all formalities were over, we started our business by 9 am. Our magazine consists of 16 pages(including the cover page). We sold it for 7 bucks. We sold the 1st copy to my class in-charge Mr.Sujaudeen. We sold the magazines to almost all staff. Our staff were very pleased to know that we came up with an innovative idea. With the profit we earned by selling those 30 copies, we made 100 copies in our college stores. We sold those 100 copies also by 3 pm. By the end of day 1, we had 831 bucks in hand :D</p>  <p><strong><u>Day 2:</u></strong></p>  <p>We sold bracelets, mobile tags and thumb rings. The credits again go to Sindhu. She is the one who got these goods. Her brother got these stuff in bulk. We invested a part of the amount we made on day 1. By the end of day 2, we had 1700 bucks with us(including what we made on day 1).</p>  <p><strong><u>Day 3:</u></strong></p>  <p>We sold the left out accessories and made 240 bucks. The sales closed by 1 pm.</p>  <p> Our 3 days of life as business women was a good experience. Am also an entrepreneur now :D</p>  <p>Thanks to SSN EDC :) </p>
