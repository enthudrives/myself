<div class="post">
I recently attended the thoughtworks recruitment process. I would like to share my experience about the same.
The process had 6 rounds.
<strong> 1. Logic Test</strong>
<strong> 2. Predicting output (20 mins)</strong>
You will be given with 4 not-too-complex programs which involves pointers, left shift, right shift operators. You need to predict their outputs.
<strong>3. Code pairing(75 mins)</strong>
You will be given with a simple scenario and asked to code for the same. You can use C or C++ or Java. Make your code more object oriented and modular. If you use C, concentrate on modularity. Once you get the expected output, one ThoughtWorks employee will evaluate your code. He will check with the test cases. Then, he will want you to do some modifications in your code. He might ask you to extend your code  or modify some functionality of your code.
<strong> 4. Tech Interviews 1 &amp; 2</strong>
To ace the interviews, you need to be strong in the basics OOP, DS, DBMS. "Strong" doesnt mean knowing all definitions. You will be given with some scenario and asked to write db tables and classes for the same. Or you may be given a scenario and asked what data structure can be applied for it. Theres no correct solution for most of the questions they ask in the interview. They just want to look at your thought process. So, dont give up. Keep thinking and most importantly, speak out what you think. Who knows..your answer may be right. Be honest. If you dont know something, admit it.

If you are not sure of anything, dont mention about it in your resume. Believe me. If you mention even a single word about something that you are not confident about, you are digging yourself a big grave.
<strong> 6. Leadership round</strong>
This is just a HR round. They ask few behavioural questions to know about your non-technical self.
After this, the recruiting team head will get back to you with the result. Hurrah! I'm a ThoughtWorker now.

Don't worry if you don't make it this time. You can try again after three months. Good Luck! :)
