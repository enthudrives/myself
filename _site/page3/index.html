			<h1><a href="/2010/12/23/warning-when-using-yum">Warning when using yum</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">I got this warning when I installed my first package in freshly installed fedora 14. Thought it would help those few ppl who might get the same error as mine.
The first package I installed is VLC. After downloading the required packages and dependencies, I got a warning.
<blockquote>warning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID 865cc9ea: NOKEY</blockquote>
and the installation stopped :(

This is because, I had installed an older version of rpm repositories.

To recover from this error,type
<blockquote>su -c
yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm</blockquote>

Of course, this is not the only way to do this.. The other easy way is to download the repositories manually by clicking the rpm file.. (as mentioned in my <a href="http://tsuganthi.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/fedora-for-beginners/">old post</a> )

The target is to update your repositories. No matter how you do it. Now yum works perfectly fine. :)

			<h1><a href="/2010/12/02/the-unfilled-answer-sheet">The unfilled Answer Sheet</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">Rewinding 15 yrs from now.. I was in 1st std. In the math annual exam, I just attempted for some 40 to 50 marks. My parents mock at me for this almost everytime I speak about math. Here is the reason for my not filling the paper.

1st and 2nd std students sit together during exams.<em> I liked the way the 2nd std students attached many papers with a single "pin" (gundoosi)</em>. They give a pin only if I write more than a sheet. I was keen about getting an additional sheet. But I forgot that I was writing an EXAM. I filled in the 1st page properly. Then wrote 2 lines in the 2nd and third pages. Left the 4th page. Got an additional sheet.  Wrote 2 lines there too. Thats it. I got a pin now. Yippee.. Attached the papers, submitted the paper and walked out. Innocent me!! I was mesmerized by that little pin. ;)
The next morning, my dad dropped me in school. I noticed my dad and math teacher talking. I knew its about my math paper only. My dad blasted on me. (Who wouldnt) She offered me an unofficial second chance. That mam's house is near mine. Dad took me to her house and I wrote the test again. Know what? I scored 90+. Everyone was wondering why I dint write properly at first. I dint have the guts to disclose the reason on that day. So I left them mazed. :P

All for the best.. From that day, our family and mam's family became friends. We go to their home for every Diwali and they come to my home for every Christmas. Only before 2 days, I told the reason to my parents. Waiting to tell mam about it. I would like to mention that kind teacher's name here.. She is Mrs.Hedwig,my class teacher in 1st, 5th std. All my primary school friends would remember her.

			<h1><a href="/2010/08/09/ssn-rules">SSN Rules!</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">When I joined college(in 2008), I remember my seniors telling me,
<blockquote>1.No rules in SSN

2. Rule number 1 must be strictly followed!</blockquote>
This was true till the end of my second year. Now strong rules have been imposed! :(

We should get leave letter from parents/warden if we bunk a lab session! Things are not always explainable. If the 3 hrs of lab is not worth attending, it is nothing wrong in bunking it and doing something constructive. We are not kiddos. We know what is right!

We are not supposed to enter hostel before 3.30 pm(except for lunch). If we are ill, we need to get permission from the class incharge before entering the hostel. Isnt it sickening?? A person who is not feeling well should roam about in college, find the staff and get leave letter signed and go to hostel??

Only three outings per month.. This sounds better than the other two rules. But it is not so! :(

What is the necessity of these rules? Every student knows his own responsiblities. They know what is good for themselves. If someone bunks, he obviously knows the consequences. Why did these new rules come into play all of a sudden? Wasnt SSN good without these rules?

I am still happy for the freedom we have in terms of mobile and dress code.

			<h1><a href="/2010/07/11/installing-openoffice-3-1-in-linux">Installing Openoffice 3.1 in Linux</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">The best way to install any software package is via terminal. But for those who are not comfortable with it, there are alternatives.

Download the package from <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/">http://download.openoffice.org/</a>

Extract the package. Go to the folder RPMS. You will have a lot of rpm files in it. Install them one by one in the right order(In the order it is displayed by default). Because they are dependent on each other.

The last package <em>"openoffice.org-ure-1.5.1-9420.i586.rpm"</em><em></em> would show some error.
<blockquote><code>Cannot install ~/OOO310_m19_native_packed-1_en-US.9420/RPMS/openoffice.org-ure-1.5.1-9420.i586.rpm  as no transaction</code></blockquote>
Leave it.

Install the menu rpm from the subfolder for menus under rpms.

You will now be able to see the list of open office packages available under Applications-&gt;Office. But clicking it would not open the application. This means link is not established between the menu and the package.

As root user, type the following
<blockquote><code>
cd /opt/openoffice.org/basis3.1
mv ure-link  ure-link.backup
ln -s /usr/lib/openoffice.org/ure ure-link</code></blockquote>
Done!

			<h1><a href="/2010/06/22/my-first-c-application">My first C++ application</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">This blog describes how to create a basic C++ application using qt-creator.
Prerequisites:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">qt-creator</a></li>
	<li> gcc</li>
	<li> g++</li>
	<li> make</li>
	<li> basic C++ knowledge</li>
</ul>
You can install gcc, g++, make by using yum or apt-get depending on which linux distro you use.

Now let us start with our application. It is to get the name of the user and display a welcome message.

1. Open Qt creator

2. File-&gt;New file or Project
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow1.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow1.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
Enter the path where your project should reside.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow2.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow2.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
The first window that has to appear in our project is a Dialog box that reads the user name. So I choose QDialog as the base class.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow3.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow3.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
3. Design the Dialog box(dialog.ui) as you wish.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow4.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/qtwindow4.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
4. The task is to display a welcome message once the user presses the OK button. This is accomplished by Signals and slots.
Here, clicking the OK button is the signal and displaying the message is the slot(in the constructor of dialog.cpp).  Declare shownext() in dialog.h under pubic slots.
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Dialog::Dialog(QWidget *parent) : QDialog(parent), ui(new Ui::Dialog)
{

ui-&gt;setupUi(this);   <strong>connect(ui-&gt;ok,SIGNAL(clicked()),this,SLOT(shownext()));</strong></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>setWindowTitle("My Application");//To set the title of the  dialog box.
}</blockquote>
</blockquote>
5. Now let us define the slot(in dialog.cpp).
<blockquote>void Dialog::shownext()
{
hide(); //to hide the dialog box which reads the name
QMessageBox::information(this,"Welcome","Congratulations,you made it !");
}</blockquote>
We are almost done. Click on Build-&gt;Run.  Or click on the green coloured triangle(like play button) in the left side pane.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q7.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q7.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q9.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q9.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
6. Let us display the user name in the welcome message.

We need to get the name entered in the text box (whose object name is "name") and display it along with the welcome message.
<blockquote>ui-&gt;name-&gt;text();</blockquote>
This reads the text entered in the text box.  Let us get it in a QString variable and display it along with the message.
<blockquote>void Dialog::shownext()
{
QString str=ui-&gt;name-&gt;text();
hide();
QMessageBox::information(this,"Welcome","Congratulations,you made it "+str + " !");</blockquote>
}

Run the code again. Yes! We made it!
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q8.png"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/q8.png?w=300" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>
Your binary file will be present in the folder where this project resides. In my case it is in /home/enthudrives/Projects/test.

You have just created an application. Your task is NOT over with this. Documentation work is as important as development work. Documentation includes creating a proper README file and INSTALL instructions.
The template of a proper README can be obtained from this
<a href="http://gitorious.org/gpa-calculator/gpa-calculator/blobs/master/README">http://gitorious.org/gpa-calculator/gpa-calculator/blobs/master/README</a>

Use a version management system(git) to manage your project efficiently.
<a href="http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/di-git-ally-managing-love-letters.pdf">http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/di-git-ally-managing-love-letters.pdf</a>
The above pdf is very useful to learn git.

		<div class="post-content"><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><span style="font-size:small;">This blog is about the first application I created. It is not a very complicated one.

It takes a hell lot of time to manually convert the characters S,A,B,.. to GPA 9,8.233 and so on.</span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><span style="font-size:small;">This vacation(after my 4th sem) is a pretty lenghty one. I did ruin my time. One bluemoon day, I thought of doing something with my qt creator. At this moment, I got the idea of making a GUI tool for calculating the GPA. The logic behind calculating the GPA is too simple. The only task is to create the interface. </span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><span style="font-size:small;">The application came out well in 3 hrs. Success! :)</span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><span style="font-size:small;">My work did not end with creating the binary file(executable file).My friend Arun SAG guided me through the rest. He very patiently guided me through creating the readme, working with version management(git). Then I realised writing the code is just 50% of the project. Documentation is another big task. </span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><span style="font-size:small;">You can calculate the GPA for as many people you want by just changing the grade. The credits will remain constant till you close the window. :)</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear:both;font-family:Georgia,&quot;text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/gpac.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><br /></a><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/gpac1.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/gpac1.png?w=242" /></a></span></div><div style="font-family:Georgia,&quot;"><br /><div><span style="font-size:small;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size:small;">Wait!

		<div class="post-content"><div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Yes. That is Nokia's slogan. Mobiles are a great innovation in this connection era. How fast messages reach the destination! No matter where the receiver is. No matter what he does. Whether he is watching tv or driving a car in heavy traffic. Info reaches him on time.</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">But I feel mobile phones are a great disturbance. It rings when we are in an important discussion or when talking with our beloved ones or when driving etc. You may suggest me to ignore the call and carry on with my work. But my mind will be diverted thinking of "OMG. Why this person calls me at this moment. Anything important? Anything serious?" etc. But these calls are far better than text messages.</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">

I've seen people who needlessly keep messaging all the time. Some people keep asking "wat doin" always. <em>(D'oh! Running commentary??)</em> . If I dont reply, they feel like I am avoiding them.

Free sms has ruined the term "eye to eye contact" in people. People find it easier to express their thoughts via messages rather than speaking out straight on their face. Messaging is a good way to stay connected with people. But most of the people go deep into messaging that they forget the fact that they are surrounded by their friends and family. They wont even know what their parents/siblings are doing right now. But they will know what their friend, at a distance, does.

</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;"><em> </em></div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;"><em><strong>Disconnecting from the present and connecting with a distance!</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Messaging is not wrong. But dont let it take control over your present. Keep your mobile aside. Look at your surroundings. You ll know how much you have missed by living with that "soap-box"!</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">To all those who are addicted to messaging, all I want to say is "<em>Open your eyes. Get a life!</em>"</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Mobiles are a great innovation. Dont let them rule you.</div>

			<h1><a href="/2009/11/12/fedora-for-beginners">Fedora for beginners</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content">I was using Ubuntu and Windows in my laptop for a long period of time. As we are behind a proxy in college and when I go home, I had to change the settings often. So I used ubuntu only when I went home. At a point of time, I very badly wanted to quit windows. Though I like ubuntu, I had a special attraction towards fedora. I installed fedora 11 in my laptop on 1st Nov,2009. Now my laptop has only Fedora. It took one full day to set my laptop to use. ie, to access net, additional packages like unrar, flash etc. I think there will be many noobs like me, who need help to do the installation quicker.  Here I list those which I did as soon as the installation was over.(To access internet)

*If you are behind a proxy,Change the proxy settings. You could find a file "yum.conf" in \etc directory. Include these two lines in the file
<div style="text-align:left;">proxy=http://proxyaddress:portnumber</div>
<div style="text-align:left;">timeout=300</div>
Then, you need to install RPM fusion repositories(free and non-free)


<blockquote>http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm
http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm
</blockquote>


Now we are done. You can access internet from your newly installed fedora. :)

Some additional packages which you would need: (You must be the root user to install softwares.Type "su" in the terminal)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Adobe flash plug-in</span>:

Get the rpm file from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer

Or type <span style="font-weight:bold;">yum install flash-plugin</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">VLC:</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">yum install vlc </span>

I think these basic packages are enough to start surfing around :)

Even when most of the people are civilized, they still have the caste feeling. Everyone is just ready to say "All are equals". But what is the big deal in practicing it in real life? On the basis of job and the position they held in the society, people divided themselves into castes. But it is nt still the same! <br /><div><br /><div>Wedding could be a good example. When a gal is in love with a guy, the parents ask "Which caste does he belong to?" instead of asking "Is he good or bad? Working or not?". And if they both are not of the same caste, the parents will be ready to marry their daughter to some dumb guy of their caste,without bothering about whether they will like each other or not!</div><div><br /><div>Communal reservation is another crap! Educational system which has to eradicate caste feeling, has communal reservation! Why is that an FC candidate with 100% marks and SC candidate with 70% marks considered equal? Is there no SC candidate who scored 100%?  Then why should there be such a foolish discrimination in the name of reservation? Why no one is able to bring a change in this?  Political leaders! OMG! They are really brilliant! They make fools out of us. In the "equality", they increase this discrimination day by day.<br /><div>People must think about it. When we are ready to change our style of living, why should this caste system still survive in the society?This has to change.</div></div></div></div>
