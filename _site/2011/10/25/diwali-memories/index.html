	<div class="post-content"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><br />In my place, Diwali is more like a festival of sound, than festival of lights. We burst hell lot of crackers every year. I learnt to burst crackers when I was 6 years old. Started off with Bijili vedi. Later improved to Laxmi vedi, atom bomb etc in the following years.<br />Every Diwali has left behind some crazy memories. Let me share one of them here. <br /><br />When I was 10, I was bursting some laxmi crackers in the morning. My parents were away and friends too left. One cracker didnot burst. I waited for a while and went near it. No smoke from it. So, I thought that the cracker is a dummy piece and took it in my hand. The thread(thiri) had gone in. I poked the thread hole with a stick and it suddenly burst in my hands. Only after that I noticed that the stick in my hand was a lit bathi(incense stick). Smoke came out from my mouth and ears(Just like <b>Vadivelu</b> in movies) :P <br />Thank God, no one saw me at that moment. I continued bursting crackers like nothing happened. Later my mom found the wound in my hand and the real diwali started for me :P<br /><br />Chinna vayasulayae terror la!! :D<br /><br />Happy and Safe Diwali everyone :) </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
