<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/image000.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="border:0 none;" title="My bday cake" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/image000.jpg?w=225" alt="Chocolate cake" width="225" height="300" border="0" /></a>June 14th of every yr use to be the best day for me. I use to celebrate it in a grand fashion. Every year, I go to my school in non-uniform(new dress), distribute sweets to friends and staffs etc. This year, june14th 2009, happened to be a sunday. My second semester examz were going on. I had math exam on 15th. So everyone were serious with their math preparations. I knew that this b'day is gonna be the worst. But my friends at hostel arranged for a chocolate cake. Cut it at 12 am. We settled bak to work within half and hr. Almost all my close friends called me by 12 and greeted me. All my celebs came to an end by around 12.30. Mom and Dad called sharp at 7.59 am, coz i was born at 8 am it seems.</p>

<div>My school friends called me and talked to me about the fun-filled b'day I had last yr. It was the best day I had with them. A cool get together, treat in a big hotel etc. This took me to the past. I became dull and my entire day was gloomy.</div>
<div>I wouldnt have felt desparate if it wasnt during exams. I couldnt spend time to relax or to meditate. I received a courier from my best buddies at school(Malini,Sharmili n Archana). They had sent me a big ceramic doll(a gal shaped doll). As it was sent via courier, it broke into pieces. This too added to my melancholy.</div>
<div>Somehow I am 18. As Malini had mentioned I am votteri nari now. Coz i can vote :P</div>
<div>Keep smiling.. :)</div>
