Wow. How beautiful life is! How gifted we are!<br />I have seen many people complaining about Life all the time for silly reasons.<br />  Why do I feel sick oft! Why does my dog feel sick often etc!<br />I dont know how these people get reasons to worry about all the time!<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">       If you can solve a problem, why worry about it? If you cannot solve a problem, why worry about it?!</span><br />If somebody criticizes you for your appearance or choices or activities, why do you bother? Its their problem. Either they really dint like your choices or they are jealous of you. Everyone is unique. We cant blame anyone for their individuality.<br />Never let anything control your life. Only you can rule yourself in the best way.<br />People keep blaming all the time and finally end up saying "Everyone hates me/avoids me!".<br />If anyone says that to you, just say "Hey dumb! Stop complaining or Go to hell!"<br />
