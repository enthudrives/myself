<div>When I was in school, I never dreamt of getting into any college like CEG or IIT or NIT like others do. I couldnt dream of medial college as I was in Math-Comp Sci group. I just wanted to get into any good institution in Chennai. I wanted to study in Chennai because my close cousins are in Chennai and I wanted to hang out with them. Also I wanted to enjoy Life. I was a kinda studious in my 11th and 12th. Did my final exams well. I came to know about SSN from my friend's Dad. He mentioned SSN in the list of good colleges. I dint know even the expansion of SSN then. Finally, my results were out. My cut off was lesser than what I expected(194.5 on 200). My friend's dad(who said about SSN) called me and asked which college I would join. I said "We will try for SSN through Management". He asked "Is it possible to get into SSN with this cut-off?"</div>
<div>I enquired many people immediately. Only after that I came to know that <strong>Money or Recommendation can do nothing in SSN</strong>. This impressed me so much. My craze to get into SSN increased. I always like doing things which people think impossible. Only after that, I came to know everything about SSN. SSN gives a long rope to its students. Mobiles are allowed. No dress code. Girls can speak with guys. Wow. Heaven. Then I visited the site www.ssn.edu.in. The infrastructure impressed me even more. With a great desire to get CSE in SSN,I filled the application form for management quota. I was called for the interview.</div>
<div>I went to the college for the first time on June 17th. Cool. Such a great college with cool lawns, well designed buildings. Many students attended the interview with me. I got 79% in the aptitude test conducted there. Most of the people with 195+ cut off, who were called on 16th scored an average of 40-50. This increased my hope to get into SSN. Then the interview. My interviewers were Dr. Srinivasan and Dr. Radha. Dr. Srinivasan is a witty person. I was nervous about the interview because i know very well that I am too bad at GK. Looking into my application, Dr.Srinivasan asked "Oh you are from tirunelveli? What is Tirunelveli famous for?". I answered with a smile "Halwa". He was asking about halwa during the entire session. And said "Your interview is over!". Thank God this was just to test my fluency! I came off.</div>
<div>After few days, the result of this selection process was announced. I got into IT(which was my 2nd option) and was in waiting list for CSE. I decided to join IT expecting a course change. College reopened. I joined the college as an IT student. After a month, I got transfered to CSE. I was the last student to undergo this course change. This is what my fate is like. I have never got anything as soon as I wish. But I will get it on the day when I myself lose hope of getting it.</div>
<div>Finally, I got into my dream course in my dream college. I am a proud SSNite now. :)</div>
