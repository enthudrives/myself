<div style="text-align:center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align:center;"><br /></div>GRC allows you to control your system by sending commands via mail. To do this, you need a simple software calledGRC. To download it, visit www.gianniamato.it. That website is in french I guess. I can give you the direct link to download.Here we go<div> http://www.gianniamato.it/grc/GRC.zip</div><div>All you have to do is hust unzip it. Run the file GRC.exe</div><div>Trust me. Its not virus!!</div><div>Now, you will be able to see this window.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><br /></div><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SkC822E9AUI/AAAAAAAAAUI/I9i4n-qPgNQ/s320/grc.JPG" border="0" alt="" /><div>Sign in here with your gmail id and password. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once you are logged in with GRC, it checks your inbox every 60 seconds for new command mails. </div><div><br /></div><div>For example, I wanna open my system's calculator. I mailed my email id from my friend's id(another laptop) with the subject [open]c:\windows\system32\calc.exe[/open]</div><div>Yep it worked!!!</div><div>Calculator opened on my desktop. </div><div><br /></div><div>This can be misused easily. Like, if I know that you have your GRC opened, I will mail you with subject shutdown and your system will be off. </div><div>It is possible for GRC users to change their commands. </div><div><br /><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SkDAczRVgAI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/qJAfHCv8rdE/s320/set.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></div><div>This is what it looks like by default. If you want to change the shutdown command to turnoff, just edit it. You are safe now..!!</div><div>You can use your web cam this way to protect your place when you are away. </div><div>Now its your turn to experiment with it..</div><div><br /></div><div>P.S: This works only with windows xp for nw. </div>
