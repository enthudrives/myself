On a pleasant evening, I met Aakriti sitting alone under a tree and enjoying the beauty of Sunset. I sat next to her and started cracking lame jokes. Her reactions were so unusual and it forced me to ask her "Are you alright?". She stared at me for a second and asked me if I had loved someone. Before I could reply, a teardrop rolled down her eyes. Her boyfriend broke up with her before a few days.

She said that she couldnt sleep all night and was not able to eat anything. I patiently listened to her break-up story and asked her "What does your heart want from that guy, now? Do you want him to come back or move on?". She wants to move on. She wants to forget everything and make a new start. Then I asked "What prevents you from doing that right now?". She said "Isnt it too early to move on?".

Aakriti is not the only soup girl around. Almost everyone would have gone through this emotional trauma. Here is a short message for all Aakriti's reading my post.
You gotta move on someday. Why is it not TODAY?? Why do you wanna postpone it? Yes. Only Time can heal the pain. But ignore the pain and be happy with what you have around you. Its human nature to fret over something thats not ours. But it is all ILLUSION! The past takes control of your mind and makes you believe that you cant get over it! Your dumb mind blindly believes that its your mourning period and makes you go crazy.

Take full control over your mind. Get involved in stuff and keep yourself occupied. Playing your favourite sport helps. Live like there is no tomorrow. Create beautiful memories before its too late. History is not gonna reward you for being heartbroken. Stand up and face the world. An emotional breakdown should only strengthen you.

Dear Aakriti, One last note. God has better plans for you. You dont know what hes upto. He has his own reasons for breaking up with you. All for the best. Keep smiling :)
