I got this warning when I installed my first package in freshly installed fedora 14. Thought it would help those few ppl who might get the same error as mine.
The first package I installed is VLC. After downloading the required packages and dependencies, I got a warning.
<blockquote>warning: rpmts_HdrFromFdno: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID 865cc9ea: NOKEY</blockquote>
and the installation stopped :(

This is because, I had installed an older version of rpm repositories.

To recover from this error,type
<blockquote>su -c
yum localinstall --nogpgcheck http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm</blockquote>

Of course, this is not the only way to do this.. The other easy way is to download the repositories manually by clicking the rpm file.. (as mentioned in my <a href="http://tsuganthi.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/fedora-for-beginners/">old post</a> )

The target is to update your repositories. No matter how you do it. Now yum works perfectly fine. :)
