FRIENDS is my most favourite sitcom so far. I never thought that I could get addicted to this sitcom. Because, I had a problem with those random voices which laugh hysterically in the middle of a conversation. But later, my brain found its way to filter out those laughters from bothering my system. I tried to start watching many times. But failed right at the Season1 Episode1.

I got a very good tip from a friend. Start watching from the 3rd season. Because the first 2 seasons are mostly to break the ice among those 6 characters. It did work!

I was insanely into FRIENDS that I watched all 10 seasons in 40 days. It did not stop there. I kept watching it again and again. Whenever I felt bored or lonely, FRIENDS was my first choice.

I started reacting like the characters in FRIENDS. Mostly like Phoebe, giving silly explanations, crazy ideas. I could relate whatever that happens around me with some scene. (Like, Joey doesn't share food) :D But the best part is, when people around me are also FRIENDS addicts and they could relate to the same scene. &lt;&lt;Whoopah&gt;&gt; (In Chandler's tone)

I understood how stupid it was after an incident. I was not able to sleep after a long tiring day, because I heard voices of Joey and Phoebe in my head. A small doze of FRIENDS got me to sleep. The next day, I made a rash decision and wiped off all seasons from my disk so that I would focus on something else. But haha. I still miss them. All 6 of them :(
