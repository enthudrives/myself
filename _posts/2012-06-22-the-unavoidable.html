Me: Finished BE in SSN, Chennai.

Stranger: Oh.. SRM? Good good..

Me: NOOO!! Its SSN. HCL Shiv Nadar's institution!!

<em>Stranger looks at me like I'm a dumb loser</em>

Stranger: Hmmm. Ok. Some college in Chennai.. Got placed?

Me: Yea. Placed in ThoughtWorks.

Stranger: Oh.. Good. But.. dint u get into CTS or TCS?

Me: (I don't wanna live on this planet anymore)

This is how my intro ends up like, most of the time.. :( :(

But, when suddenly a random stranger appears and says.. "Hey thats cool.. Great going kiddo..", I smile and nod.. Like a boss :D
