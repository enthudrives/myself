Rewinding 15 yrs from now.. I was in 1st std. In the math annual exam, I just attempted for some 40 to 50 marks. My parents mock at me for this almost everytime I speak about math. Here is the reason for my not filling the paper.

1st and 2nd std students sit together during exams.<em> I liked the way the 2nd std students attached many papers with a single "pin" (gundoosi)</em>. They give a pin only if I write more than a sheet. I was keen about getting an additional sheet. But I forgot that I was writing an EXAM. I filled in the 1st page properly. Then wrote 2 lines in the 2nd and third pages. Left the 4th page. Got an additional sheet.Â  Wrote 2 lines there too. Thats it. I got a pin now. Yippee.. Attached the papers, submitted the paper and walked out. Innocent me!! I was mesmerized by that little pin. ;)
The next morning, my dad dropped me in school. I noticed my dad and math teacher talking. I knew its about my math paper only. My dad blasted on me. (Who wouldnt) She offered me an unofficial second chance. That mam's house is near mine. Dad took me to her house and I wrote the test again. Know what? I scored 90+. Everyone was wondering why I dint write properly at first. I dint have the guts to disclose the reason on that day. So I left them mazed. :P

All for the best.. From that day, our family and mam's family became friends. We go to their home for every Diwali and they come to my home for every Christmas. Only before 2 days, I told the reason to my parents. Waiting to tell mam about it. I would like to mention that kind teacher's name here.. She is Mrs.Hedwig,my class teacher in 1st, 5th std. All my primary school friends would remember her.
