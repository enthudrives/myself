<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">The one thing i miss so much about my childhood is "video games".<br />Mario was my first hero. Jungle book, Adventure Island, Lion king, Car racing, bike racing,contra are a few more games that linger in my mind always.<br />I clearly remember all these games, even their background music. I remember the days when I was so addicted to these games that I wouldnt even sleep dreaming about how to cross levels.<br />The PC version of those games are available. But they can never match the pleasure obtained from playing with video games.. Those joysticks, cassettes can never be replaced. Play station, Kinetic games will always bow to video games.<br /><br />I came across this site recently. I found all my childhood heroes here. You can play games online in this site.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/nintendo/nintendo-games.php">http://www.1980-games.com/us/old-games/nintendo/nintendo-games.php</a><br /><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3378940211063296479-7103891438860402652?l=tsuganthi.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
