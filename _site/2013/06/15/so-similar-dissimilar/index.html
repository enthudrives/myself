As a newbie to Python, who before few months was a newbie to Ruby, I felt Ruby &amp; Python so similar in so many ways.
They are both dynamic. The syntax looks similar. And..They both have "print" statement :P When I started writing code in python, I tried everything in the ruby way and my python interpreter threw tomatoes at me for killing the language. Then I realised how good a Ruby programmer I was :P

Method definitions start with def. But they don't end with "end". Python code is so beautiful. Well indented. Spaces convey a lot.

Return statement is optional in ruby. The value of the last evaluated expression is returned implicitly. But in python, methods don't return anything unless you explicitly "return" something.

In Ruby I often do something like, <strong>print "something" if condition. </strong>But I truly miss this in python.

Comparing to RubyGems, pip and easy_install are equally good package managers.

Figuring out the python equivalents of my frequently used ruby methods was not that hard.

<strong>inspect</strong> in ruby is equivalent to __dict__ .

Pry pry pry. Without you, I would have been devastated. Pdb is here to save me here!

One big disappointment is there is nothing like DjangoCasts(unlike RailsCasts) :( But djangodocs provide a very clear documentation.

My experience with python is so far so good. I will definitely add more as and when I explore. :)
