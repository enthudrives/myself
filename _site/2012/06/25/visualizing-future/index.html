	<div class="post-content">All of us get dreams when we sleep. Not everyone remembers it. And even if we remember, we remember only 5% of it. I've heard people saying dreamy sleep implies disturbed sleep. But, my sleep is incomplete without dreams.. I love sleeping because of the dreams I get.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<img title="Dreams" src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/dreaming-1721.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="480" height="319" /> Wanna learn more about Dreams..[/caption]

You may call me crazy. But most of my dreams come true. I get solutions to most of my confusions, in my dreams. If I meet someone new, I often get dreams describing how close I'm gonna get with that person.

I once had a dream like a friend of mine(say Alice), inviting me for her wedding. When I woke up, mom says Alice's parents came home for inviting us for her wedding! How weird is that?

Another day, I had a dream like my friend romantically involved with a guy.. That night she calls me and tells that she is in love with him!

I saw my sister in a new house, celebrating house warming.. In two days, my dad told that my sis has got a new home.

Recently, when I took a nap, I visualized one of my friends dressed up like a bride and inviting me to her place. When I woke up, I found that she was getting engaged on that same day!

And a lot more dreams I've had are even more crazy..the food I'm gonna have, the color of dress someone is gonna wear..etc.

My intuitions are not any less comparing to these crazy dreams.I hear something in my head before I lose something. My pen drive, N72 mobile phone, umbrella &amp; even my slippers. Crazy..

I dont understand the scientific reason behind it. But I strongly believe that Mind has the capacity to visualize future.

Its not just me. All of us get dreams. But we forget them,mostly. If your dream is not about something that you already know, it sure has something to do with your future. If you remember your dreams, dont just ignore them. Think about it. If you see something that you dont like or dont want, try to avoid it in real life. :)
