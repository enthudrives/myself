<div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Atheists say that GOD doesnt exist. But I am no atheist. There are people who create diversity among people in the name of religion. I am not such a person also. I belong to another group of people who believe in the uniqueness of GOD. </span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I hope you believe that GOD created all of us. Also the animals, birds, trees etc. There are two different terms,GOD and Lord.</span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">According to me, God is the creator. People who were really good in some way are Lords. (hope u know about immortality of soul) God cannot manage this big Universe. So Lords(who are specially talented) assist God. Sounds funny huh?
</span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">An incident:</span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">One day, there arose this kind of discussion in my English class. I was whispering this. My neighbour stared at me and started laughing. I hesitated to say it aloud. After few minutes of argument, my English master gave the same explanation as I did; He added that this explanation was provided by some saint in his book(written centuries agao)! My neighbour was amazed! Even I was. </span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">
</span></div>
<div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">God who created us knows what is good and what is bad. Also He knows what we need and when we need. God is ready to present you the most valuable gifts in this World. But you are not ready to accept them. You keep asking God every second. But you never listen to his words. </span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">
</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Why God doesnt respond me when I was in trouble?</span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">God knows that I know to come out of that situation myself; or probably God wants me to learn a lesson; gain experience out of it.</span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">
</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Why God didnot help me overcome my failure?</span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Because,God wanted me to know the pain of failure; to realize my mistakes; to realize why I lost;To realize never to repeat it again.</span></span></div>
</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">
</span></div>
<div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">If you are depressed or feel like you need something, you go to the temple; perform ceremonies; pray God. But have you ever done all these when you are happy?? You fail to thank God when you are happy. But still God keeps giving you.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#009900;">You may forget God. But He never does</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#009900;">.</span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span">
</span></div>
</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span">I don't believe in going to temples; ceremonies and all those. I believe that God is everywhere. God speaks to you in the form of your conscience. God resides in your mind. Keep your mind clean and tidy,to the extent the monks keep the temple clean. So, be truthful to yourself. That is more than enough. God will be happy. </span></span></div>

This is the problem faced by many people like me. First let me give a brief intro of myself. </span></span></span></span>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Born in a middle class family in Tirunelveli(a not so developed city). Only daughter to my parents. Had a good neighbourhood. Lot of good friends since childhood. Not just friends. I would say "another family" rather. I dint have the feeling that am the only child. Was surrounded by friends often. </span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Now let me say about my schooling. Did till my 10th in a good Convent school.Convent schools do not just spread Christian religion.They preach True Christian values;True definition of Human Life. This school had taught me loads about Life;purity of soul;Eternal Glory; Virtues. The motto of my school is "Virtue is our strongest shield". It is a Girls' school. The teachers were partial. I dint get any oppurtunity to realise my hidden talents till my 8th. I realised that I had a very good</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#9999ff;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">leadership quality</span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> from my English Teacher, in my 8th class. My class teacher in 9th n 10th, she showed me who I am exactly. Now I enter my Higher Secondary Schooling. I entered an orthodox Hindu school(contradictory right?). I got a hand full of good friends by the end of 11th class. All of us enjoyed learning. All of us were almost of the same kind. I felt great when I was accompanied by all those people. Lion may be the king of the Forest;But its pride increases when it is surrounded by many other lions. None of us had any kind of jealous or superiority complex. Our friendship became thicker during the summer vacation(after my exams were over). We knew very well that we may be seperated (by distance) when we enter college. But still, this fear dint affect our happiness at that time. Now,College life. I am in a very good institution(in Chennai,a developed city) now. I have met a lot of people now. Here too I have a number of friends. They are from various parts of the State. A few from other states too. Lots of changes in behavior,attitude,topics in which people are interested etc.May be, it is all the effects of westernisation! But still I enjoy Life in my own way. But the difference is, I </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#9999ff;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">wear the mask of a quiet gal</span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> in the coll.I dint change myself to a quiet gal. Coz,still there are people who says that I am a chatterbox!!! Till the end of 12th,I had more than 100 </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#9999ff;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">good</span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> friends. The way we mingle with each other is entirely different from those people whom I met in my coll.I was surrounded by friends all the time. I have never felt lonely before. What people near me tell often is,"You are the source of Joy". But now!! I couldn't find even a single soul like my school pals. Words couldn't explain,how a gal brought up like me would feel under this situation.Everyday is a battlefield. I could take this too in an optimistic manner. These incidents too teach me about what Life. Every </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">incident teaches something about Life. I learnt to be what I am, whereever I am.</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> Mind filled with </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Golden memories</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">;Eyes filled with tears,in search of them. Will I get back those golden days?</span></span></span></div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">As days pass by, I got used to all these and realised that I need a change.

		<div class="post-content"><span style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:130%;"><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/poss2.jpg"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/poss2.jpg?w=246" alt="" border="0" /></a></span><span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">  </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Possessiveness is the feeling that "Mine is mine;only mine! Only I have the rights on it. No one else does!". This feeling might seem funny. But it is dangerous. Normally, most of the people suffer from this hard feeling ontheir beloved ones. This is due to their fear of losing them<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:normal;">.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="font-family:Papyrus;font-size:130%;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Most of the people are possessive on their girl friend or boy friend. This is actually because the possessive soul considers his mate more valuable, precious that he/she is not ready to lose them. They want their mate to spend time only with them and for them. This possessiveness makes them prevent their mate from speaking with the opposite sex. But the mate might interpret this as suspection. This leads to lot of problems in their relationships and finally ends with a break up!</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;font-family:0;"><span style="font-family:Papyrus;"><div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><br /></span></span></span><div style="text-align:justify;"><span><span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><span><span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><span><span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><span><span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/possess2.jpg"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/possess2.jpg?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">This possessiveness could exist not only between lovers. But also between friends. If your true friend starts talking more with someone else even when you are near, you will feel left alone. You may feel that you are ignored;insecure etc. And you may even yell at your friend for no reason.<br /></span></span></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><br /><br /></span></span></span><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/quote272.gif"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/quote272.gif?w=300" alt="" border="0" /></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">The best way to overcome this is, you should stay quiet. Think well. You will realise that you are not ignored. Your friend will not go anywhere. If at all your friend leaves you, let him go. He will come back realizing your worth.<br /><br /><br /><br /></span></span></span></div><div><a href="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/my_teddy2.jpg"><img src="http://tsuganthi.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/my_teddy2.jpg?w=212" alt="" border="0" /></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">People who were born with</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(204,0,0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> no siblings</span></span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> are more prone to this hard feeling. They are never used to sharing things. They want everything their way. They expect full love from their friends. They would not let it shared by anyone. There is no room to blame possessive people. It is better to make them overcome possessiveness and maintain a healthy relationship with people in the society.<br /><br /></span></span></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">People often confuse with the words "Possessiveness" and "Jealousy". Jealousy may arise even without love. But possessiveness comes out of true love from within. </span></span></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(204,0,0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Don't hate your mates for being possessive. If a person is possessive on you, it means that he loves you very much and expects the same love from you.</span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:rgb(204,0,0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:georgia;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"> </span></span></span></span></div></div></span></span></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3378940211063296479-1253232307702992726?l=tsuganthi.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
