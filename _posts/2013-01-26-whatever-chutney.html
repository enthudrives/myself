<p>I've always thought making Chutney is a short, yet more complicated process than washing badly soiled utensils.</p><p>Here's the recipe:</p><ul><li>Peel about 20 onions.</li><li>Chop them to medium sized pieces.</li><li>Slize 2 tomatoes into 4 (or 6) pieces each.</li></ul><p>50% of the work done!</p><p>In a frying pan, pour a tea spoon oil, let it heat for about 30 seconds; Add some mustard &amp; urad dhal. Wait till it splutters. Add 2 red chillies, 5 pieces of garlic and some curry leaves. Add the chopped onions, tomatoes and fry for about 3 minutes. </p><p>Turn off the stove and take a break for 5 mins. If you don't let it cool down for a while, the mixie jar will become hot.</p><p>Then, grind all these beautifully fried ingredients in a mixie. Add salt to taste. I normally add a teaspoon of salt.</p><p>Tada. Chutney ready. </p><p>If you add more tomatoes, you can call it tomato chutney. more chillies? Call it Kara chutney(spicy chutney). After all, Whats in a name? :)</p>
