We have met a lot of ppl and everyone would have some positive and some negative qualities in them. Everyone is right in their point of view. We dont have the right to blame others' individuality.<br />One of my friends(imaginary friend only :P) is short tempered. I cant tell "D'oh! Shes a short tempered idiot. So I can never talk to her. I cant be friendly with her. blah blah n stuff!". If I feel that she is a short tempered psych, its my responsibility to talk to her in such a way that I dont prick her temper. I can let her know that she is short tempered and I can give her time to nullify that. But I cant hurt her for her being short tempered.<br />
