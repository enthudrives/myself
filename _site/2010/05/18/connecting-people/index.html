<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Yes. That is Nokia's slogan. Mobiles are a great innovation in this connection era. How fast messages reach the destination! No matter where the receiver is. No matter what he does. Whether he is watching tv or driving a car in heavy traffic. Info reaches him on time.</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">But I feel mobile phones are a great disturbance. It rings when we are in an important discussion or when talking with our beloved ones or when driving etc. You may suggest me to ignore the call and carry on with my work. But my mind will be diverted thinking of "OMG. Why this person calls me at this moment. Anything important? Anything serious?" etc. But these calls are far better than text messages.</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">

I've seen people who needlessly keep messaging all the time. Some people keep asking "wat doin" always. <em>(D'oh! Running commentary??)</em> . If I dont reply, they feel like I am avoiding them.

Free sms has ruined the term "eye to eye contact" in people. People find it easier to express their thoughts via messages rather than speaking out straight on their face. Messaging is a good way to stay connected with people. But most of the people go deep into messaging that they forget the fact that they are surrounded by their friends and family. They wont even know what their parents/siblings are doing right now. But they will know what their friend, at a distance, does.

<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;"><em> </em></div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;"><em><strong>Disconnecting from the present and connecting with a distance!</strong></em></div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Messaging is not wrong. But dont let it take control over your present. Keep your mobile aside. Look at your surroundings. You ll know how much you have missed by living with that "soap-box"!</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">To all those who are addicted to messaging, all I want to say is "<em>Open your eyes. Get a life!</em>"</div>
<div style="text-indent:0;margin:0;">Mobiles are a great innovation. Dont let them rule you.</div>
