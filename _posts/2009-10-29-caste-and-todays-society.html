<div><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SulYEbYAceI/AAAAAAAAAdk/21V7gzdnfBA/s1600/hands.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GE6W93O8vO0/SulYEbYAceI/AAAAAAAAAdk/21V7gzdnfBA/s320/hands.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div>Caste system prevails in India from time immemorial. Even when most of the people are civilized, they still have the caste feeling. Everyone is just ready to say "All are equals". But what is the big deal in practicing it in real life? On the basis of job and the position they held in the society, people divided themselves into castes. But it is nt still the same! <br /><div><br /><div>Wedding could be a good example. When a gal is in love with a guy, the parents ask "Which caste does he belong to?" instead of asking "Is he good or bad? Working or not?". And if they both are not of the same caste, the parents will be ready to marry their daughter to some dumb guy of their caste,without bothering about whether they will like each other or not!</div><div><br /><div>Communal reservation is another crap! Educational system which has to eradicate caste feeling, has communal reservation! Why is that an FC candidate with 100% marks and SC candidate with 70% marks considered equal? Is there no SC candidate who scored 100%?  Then why should there be such a foolish discrimination in the name of reservation? Why no one is able to bring a change in this?  Political leaders! OMG! They are really brilliant! They make fools out of us. In the "equality", they increase this discrimination day by day.<br /><div>People must think about it. When we are ready to change our style of living, why should this caste system still survive in the society?This has to change.</div></div></div></div>
