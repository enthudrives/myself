Please don't ask me why I bought that domain. I've been asking that to myself for a long time now. I just liked the domain name. It sounds cool. Doesn't it? "Enthu Drives Me".

Now that the domain name is *mine*, what can I do with it? Many people suggested me to point it to my blog. For a person who writes once in a blue moon, a domain name just to point to my blog is not a great idea. If you have any suggestions, let me know.
